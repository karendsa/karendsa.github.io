I'm a Doctoral Candidate at Purdue University, advised by Dr. Snehasis Mukhopadhyay, Computer Science @Purdue University and Dr. Shiaofen Fang, Computer Science @Indiana University. 

My work lies at the intersection of multimodal AI, natural language processing and human in the loop techniques. I am broadly interested in developing algorithms in AI for social good applications especially in AI for education. 

The focus of my research is to derive human behavioral patterns from videos using mutimodal inputs. The goal is to improve STEM retention in academia by providing instructor feedback through AI using uncertainty analysis and RLHF methods in generative AI.
