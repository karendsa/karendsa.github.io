### Presentations 
1.	**"Empowering Educators: Integrating LLMs and Multimodal AI in cPLTL to achieve educational goals"**  
Women in Data Science 2024, Stanford University, March 8, 2024
Description: To explore group behavior in online learning environments, we introduce multimodal AI and explore LLMs to predict human behavior based on lexical, audio, and facial features extracted from the discussions. [Presentation](https://www.widsworldwide.org/events/event/wids-stanford-2024/)

2. **"Bridging the Gap: Women in Tech"**
Collaborative Women's Summit 2024
Bloomington, Indiana University, March 2, 2024
Computer science is ubiquitous in our everyday life activities. With the onset of digital transformation, every industry is experiencing a constant demand for computer science professionals. However, this trend is not spread evenly across genders. The session sheds light on the factors that prevent women from seeking careers in software and computing and includes solutions to mentorship, initiatives, awareness and advocacy for women in tech.[Presentation]()

3. **"AI4Ed Vision 2034: Prioritizing Use Cases for Equitable Impact"**
Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), Workshop on AI for Education: Bridging Innovation and Responsibility 2024
Vancouver, Canada, February 20-27, 2024
Computer science is ubiquitous in our everyday life activities. With the onset of digital transformation, every industry is experiencing a constant demand for computer science professionals. However, this trend is not spread evenly across genders. The session sheds light on the factors that prevent women from seeking careers in software and computing and includes solutions to mentorship, initiatives, awareness and advocacy for women in tech.

7. **"Harness the Power of AI with Data"**
Collaborative Women's Summit 2023
Bloomington, Indiana University, March 3, 2023
The talk is geared towards women looking to explore computing majors and jobs in computer science. The session goals include empowering women to learn new skills in AI and seek STEM careers. The session will provide an overview of a research classification problem in healthcare with a demo of building multiple machine learning models- decision tree, logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine in Python.

8. **"AI-Augmented Peer-Led Team Learning for STEM Education"**
AAC&U: Transforming STEM Higher Education
Arlington, D.C., November 3-5, 2022
The talk presents a research project that builds an AI tool to allows the Professor to determine if the specific cyber Peer Led Team Learning session is progressing in an expected manner. The AI tool can make corrective actions and provide feedback to the stakeholders by way of sentiment, audio and video features.

9. **"Can Artificial Intelligence (AI) be used to monitor and enhance cPLTL workshops?"**
2022 Biennial Conference on Chemical Education
West Lafayette, Purdue University, July 31, 2022.
There is a lack of AI-supported tools that assist the instructor in providing feedback of progression of learning â€“ collaboration, effectiveness, participation. This preliminary study demonstrates that AI-Enabled models such as Support Vector Regression and Neural Networks have the potential to monitor real-time cPLTL session data for session effectiveness.

10. **"Data Ethics Practices with Machine Learning and AI"**
Women in Data Science Conference
West Lafayette, Purdue University, March 7-8, 2022. 
Affiliated to Women in Data Science, Stanford University
Data ethics encompasses the ethical topics that surround the use of data. Machine learning in AI applications has improved our lives. However, problems of bias, fairness and privacy unknowingly creep in after deployment. The presentation discusses data ethics considerations in the real world, tools available to mitigate the risk from data bias and a demonstration of bias in a dataset.[Presentation](http://sites.lib.purdue.edu/wids/index.html)
